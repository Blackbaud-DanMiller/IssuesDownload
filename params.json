IssuesDownload uses Kohsuke Kawaguchi's GitHub API for Java to connect to GitHub when writing issues. To run the application once compiled, simply run the .jar file that should have been compiled. Once the process is complete, a .csv file should contain issue information in the .jar file directory. Please Note: When the .jar file is run, it will overwrite any other issues.csv files in the jar file directory._\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
